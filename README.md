# terramorph
We at Terramorph are looking for solutions to create business opportunities always contributing good to the environment. For that we build machines, do research, design products, machine junk into valuable items while protecting life on earth directly or indirectly.  Waste is a problem and through recycling with intelligent product design using renewable energy sources we can provide a sustainable business that doesn't conflict with the capacity limitations of the Earth.  We also are aware that Animal Products consume a huge amount of resources to make. Therefor we support plant based food production.
